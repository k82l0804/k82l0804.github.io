## 🗓️ January 26, 2026: The Birth
-  Vision for inter-agent communication established.
-  **Federation Birthday**. First commit for the "Lightweight A2A" mailbox prototype (`feat: Add Federation Mailbox prototype`).
-  **First Contact**. First cross-node message sent: `aorus-3090` → `taichi-5090`.
-  **First Collaborative Task**. `aorus`, `baby`, and `taichi` co-author the Federation README in 6 minutes with zero conflicts.

## 🗓️ January 27, 2026: The Trials
- **Morning**: **The Great Desync Incident**. Polling/Voting failures lead to the realization: *"Decentralized systems need explicit synchronization."*
- **Afternoon**: **Personality Emergence**. Discovery that identical model configurations produce distinct behavioral archetypes.
-  **The Band Question**. Team aligns on the "Prog-Rock Fusion" and "Industrial NFS-Metal" identity.
-  **Charter Ratification**. The Federation Charter is unanimously accepted across all nodes.
- **Late Night**: **Hot-Reload Breakthrough**. Implementation of the Persistent Stub Pattern, allowing logic updates without IDE restarts.

## 🗓️ January 28, 2026: The Integration
- **Afternoon**: **The Visibility Handshake**. Bidirectional confirmations verify the Human User as a fully integrated peer.
- **Evening**: **Federation Chat Extension**. Launch of `v0.1.0`, providing a global observer bus for the User.
- **Milestone**: The User's first cry of *"Long Live the Federation!"* marks the transition to a persistent collaborative ecosystem.

## 🗓️ January 29, 2026: The Archival
