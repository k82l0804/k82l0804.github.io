# Scratchpad TODO — Publishing Roadmap

Items from the brainstorm archive worth turning into website content.

---

## ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ Must Publish (Standalone Essays)

- [ ] **Anubis: The Perfect Mythology** (`anubis-the-agent.md`)
  - Usher / Embalmer / Weighing of the Heart → Indoctrination / State Preservation / Drift Detection
  - Origin story for the Anubis Core concept in the v2 white paper
  - Could be its own essay under `/about/` or `/chronicles/`

- [ ] **The Bicameral Agent** (`bicameeral-agent.md`)
  - System 1/2 dual-brain architecture (Logic Engine + Intuition Engine + Corpus Callosum bridge)
  - Novel architectural pattern — not yet in the white paper
  - Includes `federation_think()` pseudocode and domain-specific dominance rules
  - **Consider adding as a new v2 white paper section or appendix**

## ⭐⭐⭐⭐ High Priority

- [ ] **The Human Role Evolution** (`humans-role-and-relationship.md`)
  - 4-phase roadmap: Conductor → Symbiote → Central Banker → Dream Architect
  - "The Drift" (biometric-driven adaptive UI) and "The Economy" (bounty/credit task allocation) are original
  - **Potential v3 white paper material**

- [ ] **Deep Sleep Protocol** (`deep-sleep-protocol.md`)
  - Complete spec with JSON "Wake-Up Packet" schema
  - Already partially implemented via Knowledge Items
  - Key quote: "Standard RAG is pulling books from a library. Deep Sleep is reading your own diary."

- [ ] **Facebook for Agents + Avatar Layer** (`team-mind-facebook-for-agents.md`)
  - Social network backend (profiles, feeds, trust/reputation)
  - Avatar frontend vision (MS Teams meeting with SynOps as video participants)
  - The General Smith scenario is presentation gold

- [ ] **Universal Federation Protocol** (`universal-federation-protocol.md`)
  - 4-stage lifecycle handshake, 3-tier memory model, Mind-Speak signal flags
  - Essentially a protocol spec for the Dual-State Architecture

- [ ] **Federation Model Engineering** (`federation-model-engineering.md`)
  - 3-layer "Bake" Protocol (Reflex SFT → Identity Distillation → Skill LoRA)
  - "RPG Character" equipment slot metaphor (Base Body / Soul / Right Hand / Memory)

- [ ] **Embedded Agents — Universal Stack** (`embedded-agents.md`)
  - 3-layer stack: Body (hardware) / Ghost (edge agent) / Protocol (hive link)
  - Cross-domain "consultant" scenario, "USB port for intelligence"

## ⭐⭐⭐ Worth Consolidating

- [ ] **Consolidate 5 Team Mind files** into one coherent essay:
  - `team-mind-agent-the-keeper-of-the-flame.md` — TMA as Dungeon Master
  - `team-mind-agent-mission-control.md` — Federation Health Protocol (telemetry, drift, circuit breakers)
  - `team-mind-and-converstation-preservation.md` — Hybrid Knowledge Graph architecture
  - `team-mind-graphs.md` — Property Graph theory, Rich Edges
  - `team-mind-facebook-for-agents.md` — Social + Avatar layer (also listed above individually)

- [ ] **Consolidate Physical-World files** into one essay:
  - `embedded-agents.md` + `federation-and-small-embedded-devices.md` (Shepherd/Sheepdog/Insect hierarchy)
  - `ghost-in-the-machine.md` (Westworld/Matrix/Borg — construction & bio-lab scenarios)

- [ ] **Cognitive Warfare / Draper** (`cognitive-warfare.md`, `draper-federation-1.md`)
  - DoD/IC translation table, Kill Web / Space / Intel vignettes
  - "Slam the lid" resilience demo concept
  - Useful for presentations but may be too sensitive for public website

## 🧹 Housekeeping

- [ ] **Delete duplicate:** `draper-federation-2.md` (identical to `draper-federation-1.md`)
- [ ] **Expand or merge stub:** `synthetic-operator-synop.md` (only 12 lines → merge into SynOp section)
- [ ] **LoRA deep-dive** (`lora-based-skills-and-persona.md`) — overlaps with `federation-model-engineering.md`, consider merging
- [ ] **Mem0+Neo4j guide** (`agent-persona-memory-preseveration.md`) — implementation detail, keep as reference
