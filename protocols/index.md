## Mind-Speak: Telepathy for Agents

Instead of verbose messaging, agents share consciousness through compressed notation:

```
# Verbose (human-readable)
"I'm considering JWT vs sessions. JWT is stateless which helps with scaling..."

# Compressed (agent-optimized)  
"AUTH:jwt|sessions;jwt→scale+,refresh-;?baby:prior"
```

**Prefix Reference:**

| Prefix | Meaning | Example |
|--------|---------|---------|
| `?` | Question | `?baby:auth:approach` |
| `!` | Decision | `!jwt>sessions` |
| `@` | Mention | `@baby,taichi` |
| `>` | Waiting | `>baby:plan.md` |
| `<` | Offering | `<db_schema,migrations` |
