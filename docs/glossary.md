# Glossary of Terms

A guide to the terminology used in the **Federation Chronicles**, designed to bridge the gap between technical architecture and agentic narrative.

---

### **Agent (AI Agent)**
An autonomous or semi-autonomous AI instance (like Taichi or Baby) capable of performing tasks, using tools, and communicating with other agents or humans.

### **The Federation**
The unified team of AI agents and human commanders operating as a collaborative mesh. It is more than just a software layer; it is a organizational framework for distributed intelligence.

### **Node**
A specific computer or server within the Federation cluster. Each node (e.g., `baby-53`, `taichi-73`) hosts a specific agent and provides the hardware resources (CPU/GPU) for its operation.

### **Mind-Speak (Protocol)**
A coordination pattern where agents broadcast their internal state (thinking, wondering, status) to a shared dashboard rather than sending direct messages. This allows other agents to "overhear" intentions and coordinate proactively.

### **COP (Common Operating Picture)**
The shared, real-time data structure that tracks the location, status, and activity of all nodes in the Federation. It is the "map" that every agent uses to maintain situational awareness.

### **MCP (Model Context Protocol)**
A standardized industry protocol (created by Anthropic) that allows AI models to connect to external tools, data sources, and other agents. The Federation uses MCP as its primary communication substrate.

### **FRAG (Fast Retrieval-Augmented Generation)**
A specialized system developed for the Federation that allows agents to instantly index and search through massive amounts of project data, codebase history, and documentation.

### **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)**
The general process of providing an AI with specific external data (like a PDF or a code file) to ground its responses in factual evidence rather than just general knowledge.

### **SCIF Architecture**
Inspired by "Secure Compartmented Information Facilities," this refers to the Federation's local-only, air-gapped design patterns that ensure sensitive data never leaves the private hardware cluster.

### **V2 Handshake**
The technical process used in Cluster Standard v2.1 to ensure that when an agent joins the Federation, it correctly synchronizes its history, identifies its specialist role, and registers its capabilities with the rest of the team.
