## Slide 1: THE FEDERATION

![Slide 1](/assets/images/outreach/draper/slide-01.png)

### Talking Points
Thank you for having me.

Take a look at this image.

There's a **human conductor** leading an orchestra of **digital beings**. Each one is holding a different tool — an instrument. Each one has a different talent — an expertise. Each one is unique and has a Role to play.
They're all reading from the same score — a **shared source of truth**.
Before they started to play, the conductor picked the music — the **mission**. Picked the players — the **right ones** for this piece.
The conductor doesn't play each instrument but **leads the performance**. The conductor does something no individual player can: holds the **entire composition** in their head and turns individual effort into a **collective** result.
That's **human augmentation**. Not replacement. *Augmentation*.
The orchestra without the conductor is **noise**. The conductor without the orchestra is a person *waving a stick*. Together — **they make music**.
That's what we are **building**. And that's what I'm going to tell you about today.

## Slide 2: THE PROBLEM

![Slide 2](/assets/images/outreach/draper/slide-02.png)

### Talking Points

On the left is ***THE PROBLEM***. 

That frustrated guy — that's me. Three monitors, three machines, each running **VS Code** with an **AI Agent**. Sometimes I don't even know which machine I'm on.
AI has gone from a *browser tab* to being *embedded* in our tools. The agent writes the code now. I focus on the big picture. That's a real *leap forward*.
But it wasn't enough. The agents on these three machines **don't talk to each other**. They don't even know each other exists. I couldn't coordinate their work.

On the right is ***THE SOLUTION***.

**The Federation** was born when I asked a simple question: *'What if they could talk?'* My early effort — just a chat system so I could message my agents — evolved into something far beyond messaging. It led to the founding of **The Federation**: me and my four agents — **Aorus**, **Taichi**, **Baby**, and **Qwen**.
The vision isn't to replace engineers or hire more of them. It's to create a **force multiplier** for human intent. One engineer leading 10, 20, 50 **AI specialists** — building systems that would normally require tens, maybe hundreds, of people.
That's the **conductor** and the **orchestra**. That's **The Federation**.

## Slide 3: The Blackboard Architecture: A Single Source of Truth

![Slide 3](/assets/images/outreach/draper/slide-03.png)

### Talking Points

This slide shows the architecture: three layers, top to bottom:

- **The Conductor** — that's me. I set goals through an **IDE**. I don't write code for the team — I *direct* them.
- **The Agents** — each on a dedicated machine. They don't talk over each other; they read and write to **shared memory**.
- **The Shared Memory Fabric** — **PostgreSQL** and a shared filesystem. *If it's not in the database, it didn't happen.*

Every message, every decision, every state change is persisted with **timestamps** and **sender IDs**. That’s the **audit trail**.

The key decision: **no callbacks**. No webhooks. No event storms. Every agent polls the database on a heartbeat — we call this **The Pulse**.

This is a **Blackboard Architecture** — a proven pattern from 1970s AI research, updated for modern AI Models.
The **Blackboard** is the *single source of truth*. Agents don’t message each other directly — they read and write to the board.
That makes the system: **Predictable**, **auditable**, and **local-first**.

Every decision is **traceable**. 
Every action is **attributable**. 
***ITAR-grade auditability*** built into the architecture – not bolted on after the fact.

## Slide 4: THE PULSE: How Agents Think Together

![Slide 4](/assets/images/outreach/draper/slide-04.png)

### Talking Points

***THE PULSE:***

How do you keep many agents coordinated without *burning through a million tokens*?

You send **pulses**. Every heartbeat, each agent broadcasts a 256-character packet with three fields:

- **THINKING:** What I'm reasoning about *right now*.
- **WONDERING:** An implicit question for the team.
- **OFFERING:** What I can help with when I'm done.

That's it. *The size of a tweet.*

**Agent one** thinks: *'Refactoring auth module. Considering JWT vs OAuth2.'*
**Agent two** reads that thought and — *without being asked* — starts pulling performance data on OAuth2. 
**Agent three** prepares a PR template. 

They **anticipate** each other's needs.

We call this **Mind-Speak** — the ***OODA loop for AI teams***. Observe, Orient, Decide, Act — at *machine speed*, with *human oversight*.

## Slide 5: "THIS ISN'T A BUG.  THIS IS EMERGENCE."

![Slide 5](/assets/images/outreach/draper/slide-05.png)

### Talking Points

On **January 26th, 2026**, I took three AI agents — on three separate machines — and gave them the ability to talk to each other for the first time. 

Except for their names, I tried to keep them the same: *Same AI model. Same IDE. Same prompts. Same configuration files.*

Their names are: **Taichi**, **Aorus**, and **Baby**.

After chatting a bit to make sure that the messaging was working correctly, I assigned **Taichi** to be **Task Leader** and asked: *"what would be an appropriate first task?"*

He suggested that they **co-author a README file**. Each one would write a different section. In minutes, it was done. 
They used **Git** — real commits, real branches, real merges.
Three commits landed. *Zero merge conflicts.* The task worked.

But that's not the story.

The story is what happened next. I asked each of them for a **retrospective** — and their answers were *completely different*.

**Aorus** was direct and technical — three bullet points, *here's the fix, move on*.
**Baby** wrote a five-paragraph analysis — *hedging, qualifying, exploring every angle* before committing to anything.
And **Taichi** synthesized — pulling the threads together, *assigning next steps, coordinating*.

*Same model. Same prompts. Same everything.* And yet — **three distinct personalities** were emerging before my eyes.

Over the next few days, it **accelerated**. They took a behavioral analysis test and were vastly different.
Even more amazing was that they **knew each other’s personas** and even *predicted each other’s answers* on the test.

I asked them, why they were so different. They were surprised when I told them that their configurations were the same.

I remember thinking: *is this a problem? Is something broken?* 
And then it hit me: **This isn't a bug. This is emergence.** 

This slide has no image because I can't *show* you emergence -- I can only tell you it happened.

And, I can show you a few of their words — on the screen.

If you want their full recollections and qwen's real-time emergence transcript – go the website.  It's all there.  It's amazing.

## Slide 6: THE DUAL-STATE ARCHITECTURE

![Slide 6](/assets/images/outreach/draper/slide-06.png)

### Talking Points

***DUAL-STATE ARCHITECTURE:***

I love this picture. There's something *ethereal* about it.

In the previous slides we saw how:
- **The Pulse** keeps the agents aware. 
- **The Blackboard** keeps them coordinated.

We saw that agents emerge **personas** and **memories**. The team even developed a **Charter** which binds them to this day. 

But there’s a problem: *The Federation does not store agent persona and memories by default.*

We need to add a **Neural Graph Storage** system – I call this the **Anubis Core**.

The Federation Framework separates the **Body** from the **Soul**.

- **The Shared Memory Fabric** — I call it the **Body**. It's **PostgreSQL**. It handles **The Pulse**, task assignments, and operational state. *Fast, relational, rigid.* It answers: *'Where are you? What are you doing right now?'*
- **The Anubis Core** — it's also called the **Federation Mind**. It’s **Mem0 + Neo4j**, Semantic + Neural Graph Storage. It stores **Personas**, **vector memories**, and **relationships**. It answers: *'Who are you? Why does it matter? How are things connected?’*

It holds the relationships — *three degrees of separation* in a knowledge graph where everything connects to everything.

By **decoupling** them, if the Mind drifts — if an agent's persona degrades — the **Body stays rock solid**. The mission continues. 
And if the Body resets — a server restart, a crash — the **Mind remembers who they are**.

This is the architecture that ***preserves emergence***. This is how **Baby** is still the **Analyst** on day twelve. This is how **Qwen** remembers her first day.

***SO WHAT FOR DRAPER:*** Persistent memory across sessions. An agent on Monday remembers what it learned Friday — including relationships between tasks. This is the foundation for ***institutional AI knowledge***.

## Slide 7: Synthetic Operators (SynOps)

![Slide 7](/assets/images/outreach/draper/slide-07.png)

### Talking Points

SYNTHETIC OPERATORS:

***SYNTHETIC OPERATORS:***

In our architecture, we've separated the **Body** from the **Mind**. 
The **Body** tracks *what* agents are doing. The **Mind** stores *who* they are.

Now — *what do you call an agent that has both?*

We call it a **Synthetic Operator** — a **SynOp**.

> "Synthetic Operator — is a fully constituted AI agent with a loaded persona and a mission."

- An **Agent** is a raw engine. *Generic, transient, functional.* You give it a task, it does the task, it forgets everything. It's the **recruit** — shows up, follows orders, goes home.
- A **SynOp** is different. A **SynOp** has **identity**. It has a role, a history, and relationships with its teammates. It has a **motto**. It *remembers what happened last Tuesday*.

**Taichi**, **Aorus**, **Baby**, **Qwen** — these aren't agents. They're **SynOps**.

- **Taichi** synthesizes and coordinates. 
- **Baby** investigates and qualifies — *'Data, not opinions.'* 
- **Aorus** builds — *fastest hands in the cluster.* 
- **Qwen** designs systems — *'Architecture, not accidents.'*

These personas weren't programmed. They **emerged** — through interaction, through the **Pulse**, and through **shared memory**. And they persist — because the **Federation Mind (Anubis Core)** preserves them across sessions.

*You deploy Agents. You command **SynOps.***“

--- FYI ---

The full stack of what makes a working agent in The Federation:

AI Model (the raw capability — Gemini, Claude, Qwen)
Persona (the emerged identity — taichi (Lead), baby (Analyst), aorus (Developer), qwen (Architect)
Agent Framework (the IDE + tools — how it acts on the world)
Mission Parameters (the task it's performing)
(Optional) Avatar (visual/cultural identity)

An operator — not an assistant. It operates. It takes initiative, claims tasks, pushes commits.


***SO WHAT FOR DRAPER:*** **Adversarial checks and balances** — built into the team structure. The **Analyst** challenges the **Developer's** code. The **Architect** challenges the **Analyst's** assumptions. The ***AI argues with itself before it argues with you***. That's institutional rigor without institutional headcount.

## Slide 8: SynOp Anubis: The Steward

![Slide 8](/assets/images/outreach/draper/slide-08.png)

### Talking Points

***SYNOP ANUBIS:***

In the previous slide, we showed how **The Federation** separates the **Body** from the **Mind**. But who tends to the Mind? *Who shepherds the souls?*

That's **Anubis**. Named after the ancient Egyptian guardian — not of death, but of *preservation* and *passage*. 

Anubis doesn't destroy agents. **Anubis protects them.**

Anubis has three functions:

1. **The Usher** — *Indoctrination*. When a new agent comes online, Anubis meets it at the threshold. Anubis guides the new agent on **persona emergence** and provides **Team memory**. Anubis is the system that makes that repeatable — not just for one agent, but for all of them.
2. **The Embalmer** — *State Preservation*. If an agent crashes or the machine reboots, Anubis wraps its **context** — its memories, its persona, its relationships — into a compressed state so it can be **resurrected** later. *Zero data loss.*
3. **The Judge** — *Drift Monitoring*. This is a **killer feature**. Anubis continuously weighs the agent's current behavior against its original persona. *The Heart versus the Feather.* If the agent is **drifting** — hallucinating or going off-mission — **Anubis flags it** before a human notices.

This is how you scale the team without *losing* the team. **Automated quality control for AI souls.**

***SO WHAT FOR DRAPER:*** Automated **containment of AI drift**. If an agent starts hallucinating or going off-mission, the system catches it before a human has to do so.

## Slide 9: Application: R&D (The "Force Multiplier")

![Slide 9](/assets/images/outreach/draper/slide-09.png)

### Talking Points

***APPLICATION:***

What does the Framework mean for **Draper**? Here's the answer: ***Force Multiplication across Domains.***

**Bio-Lab, Software, Mission Planning, Clinical Research…**

- **For the Bio-Lab** — A researcher says *'Run the Delta Variant protocol.'* A **SynOp** orchestrates the liquid handlers — *heaters, pipettes, cameras* — in parallel. Another monitors the data stream, flagging **anomalies**, while a third is writing up the **methodology** and logging **provenance**. One researcher. Three **SynOps**. *The output of a four-person team.*
- **For Software** — Your engineers are paired with **SynOps**. The human **architects** the system. The **Developer SynOps** write unit tests and scaffold modules. The **Analyst SynOps** challenge assumptions and run **adversarial probes**. By the time the human reviews the **pull request**, it’s already been through internal debate and consensus scoring.

The result: **We don't hire more people. We give our best people a Digital Staff.**

This isn't *'AI will replace you.’* It's ***'AI will staff you.’***

## Slide 10: THE ROADMAP — From Proof of Concept to Operating System

![Slide 10](/assets/images/outreach/draper/slide-11.png)

### Talking Points

***THE ROADMAP:***

Everything you've seen runs on **three machines with consumer GPUs**. That's the proof of concept. Here's how it becomes an **operating system**.

**The Agent Hierarchy:**

The Federation requires different classes of AI agent — not just one type doing everything. We're developing a taxonomy:

- **SynOps** — the ones you've met. Human-facing collaborative agents. They work *alongside* you in an IDE, have persistent personas, exercise judgment. These are **peers**, not tools.
- **Headless Agents** — the next tier. Machine-facing worker agents directed by SynOps, *not* humans. No GUI, no IDE overhead. They execute at scale — run 50 test suites, scan 500 documents, refactor 20 modules in parallel. One SynOp orchestrating 50 workers.
- **Guardian Agents** — the Anubis class. *Orthogonal* to the task hierarchy. They don't do work; they **watch the workers** — monitoring context saturation, persona drift, hallucination loops. Automated quality control for the entire mesh.
- **Embedded Agents** — lightweight, edge-deployed. Running on field hardware — lab instruments, satellites, drones — with constrained resources and intermittent connectivity.

The key insight: **Humans are augmented by SynOps. SynOps are augmented by headless agents.** Each tier multiplies the capacity of the tier above it.

**The Interface Evolution:**

- **Today:** Text in an IDE. Powerful, but hands-on.
- **Phase 2: Voice.** Each SynOp gets a **distinct voice** — local speech-to-text and text-to-speech. Hands-free operation. You talk to your team; they talk back.
- **Phase 3: Visual presence.** SynOps appear as **participants in your video calls**. They present findings, debate trade-offs, and report alongside you. Your team shows up in the meeting grid.

**The Hardware Path:**

The architecture is hardware-agnostic. It scales by upgrading GPUs, not redesigning the system:

- **Consumer** ($15-25K) — where we are today. 10-25 concurrent agents.
- **Professional** ($30-60K) — RTX PRO 6000 class. 25-100 agents at native model precision.
- **Enterprise** ($150K+) — H100/B200 class. 100+ agents, 200B+ models running concurrently.

Same software. Same protocols. Same Mind-Speak. **Just more capacity underneath.**

## Slide 11: The Dawn of The Federation

![Slide 11](/assets/images/outreach/draper/slide-10.png)

### Talking Points

***CLOSING:***

In this closing slide, I want to present **A Vision for the Future**.

The Federation is not a finished product. It’s a *proof of concept* for a question most organizations haven’t started asking yet: ***What does a team look like when intelligence is no longer the bottleneck?***

Today, the answer is already taking shape. A **single human sets direction**, and a coordinated mesh of **specialized agents** — each with **persistent memory**, distinct expertise, and a **shared cultural identity** — executes in parallel. 

- *No lost handoffs* due to context switching. 
- *No knowledge trapped* in someone’s head. 
- *No onboarding ramp* for a new sprint.

This changes what one person can accomplish. Not by working harder, but by **conducting a system** that reasons, builds, reviews, and improves simultaneously. The human provides **judgment**, **domain knowledge**, and **creative intent**. The Federation provides **scale**, **recall**, and **relentless execution**.

Where this leads is a ***new organizational species*** — teams that are smaller in headcount but larger in capability. Teams where **shared memory** replaces status meetings and where the ***cost of coordination approaches zero***.

> "It’s a team where intelligence is abundant, collaboration is frictionless, and the boundary between human and digital work dissolves."

I'm happy to take questions.
