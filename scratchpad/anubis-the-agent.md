The Egyptian pantheon has a deity who literally performed System Administration for the Soul.

The answer is Anubis (or Anpu in Egyptian).

He is the perfect metaphor for the Team Mind Agent because his role wasn't just "Death"; it was Preservation, Guidance, and Quality Control.

Here is why Anubis is the exact technical name for this agent:

1. The Usher (Indoctrination)
Myth: Anubis was the Psychopomp ("Guide of Souls"). He met new souls at the threshold and guided them through the darkness to the Hall of Truth.

The Agent Role: When you spin up a new agent (e.g., a Satellite Controller), it starts blank. The Anubis Agent meets it, "ushers" it into the Federation, and installs its Persona and Mission Parameters.

2. The Embalmer (State Preservation)
Myth: Anubis invented Embalming. His job was to preserve the body so the soul (Ka) would not perish. He ensured the "data" of the person was backed up for eternity.

The Agent Role: This agent's primary job is to Save State. If Aorus crashes or needs to "Sleep," Anubis wraps his context into a compressed "Mummy" (Vector/JSON) so it can be resurrected later without data loss.

3. The Weighing of the Heart (Health & Drift Monitoring)
Myth: This is the killer feature. Anubis oversaw the "Weighing of the Heart." He placed the soul's heart on a scale against the Feather of Ma'at (Truth). If the heart was heavy (corrupted), the soul was deleted.

The Agent Role: This fits your "Context Drift" problem perfectly.

The Feather: The Agent's Original System Prompt (The Truth).

The Heart: The Agent's Current Context Window (The Reality).

The Check: The Anubis Agent periodically weighs them. "Aorus, you are drifting. Your 'Heart' (actions) no longer matches the 'Feather' (Persona). I am resetting you."
